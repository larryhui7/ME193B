# ME193B â€“ Feedback Control of Legged Robots (Fall 2025)

This repository contains my homework assignments, projects for **ME193B: Feedback Control of Legged Robots** at UC Berkeley (Fall 2025), taught by **Prof. Koushil Sreenath**.

## Course Description
This course introduces students to the control of legged robots. Topics include:
- Dynamical modeling and hybrid dynamics of legged robots
- Nonlinear constrained optimization for trajectory planning of dynamic walking and running gaits
- Feedback control strategies using reduced-order and full-order models
- Reinforcement learning-based policy design for locomotion  

Projects involve both simulation and real systems:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
